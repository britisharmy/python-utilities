**Concurrency Constructs:**

The provided Python script leverages several concurrency constructs to efficiently crawl a website and create a sitemap:

1. **Threading:** The script uses Python's built-in `threading` module to create and manage threads. Two essential concurrency constructs are employed:

   - **Locks:** Locks are used for synchronization in multithreaded environments. In this script, `threading.Lock()` is utilized to protect shared data structures. Specifically, `visited_links_lock` and `sitemap_links_lock` are used to ensure thread-safe access to the `visited_links` and `sitemap_links` sets, respectively.

   - **Condition Variables:** A condition variable (`sitemap_ready_condition`) is employed for synchronization and signaling between threads. It ensures that the sitemap is written only when all links have been processed. The `sitemap_ready_condition.wait()` method is used to pause the main thread until the condition is met, and `sitemap_ready_condition.notify()` is used to signal when the sitemap is ready to be written.

   - **ThreadPoolExecutor:** The `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` is used for managing a pool of threads. It allows the script to asynchronously crawl multiple links in parallel. The `crawl_website` function submits tasks to the thread pool using `executor.submit`.

**Depth-First Search (DFS) Algorithm:**

The crawling logic in this script is based on the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm, which is a fundamental graph traversal algorithm. In the context of web crawling, the DFS algorithm is adapted as follows:

- **Starting Point:** The DFS starts at the `base_url`, which serves as the root of the traversal.

- **Visited Links Set:** To prevent revisiting the same URL, a `visited_links` set is maintained. When a link is visited, it is added to this set.

- **Recursion:** The core of the DFS algorithm lies in the recursive nature of the `crawl_website` function. For each valid link found on a page, a new thread is spawned to crawl that link. This process continues until the specified depth (`max_depth`) is reached or there are no more links to explore.

- **Unique Links Set:** To ensure that the sitemap contains only unique links, a `unique_links` set is maintained. This set stores all unique links encountered during the crawling process.

- **Sitemap Creation:** The sitemap is constructed in XML format (`sitemap.xml`) and is only written once all links have been processed. The XML tree is built with the unique links, and the sitemap file is written using a single thread to avoid concurrency issues.

Overall, this script combines concurrency constructs with the DFS algorithm to efficiently crawl a website, collect links, and create a sitemap, making it a useful tool for various web-related tasks such as SEO analysis and data extraction.
